Hello user, this program is designed to be configured from the configuration.txt 
file located below. In order to ensure that your program runs in production mode
you must type "production" into the line. If the line has "training" in it or any
other value the program will default to training mode. 

Files that have orders in them with common format errors will be pushed to the 
Order_Date_Error_Files error handling repo and will await manual handling.
This includes duplicate global id's.

Sincerely, the Creator.
